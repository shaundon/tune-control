{"body":"tune-control for Mac OS X\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nWTF?\r\n----\r\n\r\ntune-control is a tiny command line program for Mac OS X that makes controlling\r\niTunes or Spotify from shell a walk in a park.\r\n\r\nBut why?\r\n--------\r\n\r\nBecause reasons. Because I needed it. Because I was bored. Because teh lulz,\r\nthat's why.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Native OS X program (no bash-wrapped AppleScript or other nonsense),\r\n* Support for iTunes and Spotify,\r\n* Play, pause, next track, previous track and info commands.\r\n\r\nCommands\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* ``play`` - play the current track (or the playlist in case of iTunes),\r\n* ``pause`` - pause the current track,\r\n* ``next`` - play the next track in the playlist,\r\n* ``prev`` - play the previous track in the playlist,\r\n* ``track`` - print basic track info to stdout,\r\n* ``state`` - print player state (e.g. Playing) to stderr,\r\n* ``player`` - print target player name to stderr,\r\n* ``home`` - open project's home page,\r\n* ``version`` - print version to stderr,\r\n* ``help`` - print usage info to sdterr.\r\n\r\nChoosing the player\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSince tune-control supports iTunes and Spotify there must be a way to choose\r\nthe controlled player. You can do it with:\r\n\r\n    $ defaults write pl.bthlabs.tune-control PlayerName <player_name>\r\n\r\nwhere ``player_name`` is either ``iTunes`` (default) or ``Spotify``.\r\n\r\nEasy peasy.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\ntune-control is licensed under MIT License.
